CuteBot, a cuteness-friendly IRC bot
====================================
Written in node.js, with love

To run: 

Rename `configuration.json.sample` to `configuration.json`, then flesh out with your Google developer API key, IRC server, and channel(s) of choice.  Then `node server.js`, and you should be good to go!

Enjoy the Cute!
